# Client

Project that acts as a business finder (mainly for restaurants). It is not intended for distribution, yet; it is merely a demonstration of skill using web technologies for potential recruiters.

## Build Status

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4a6764c5-39f3-4f9d-a730-0c7fc1370a76/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/projectaura/deploys)

## Motivation

During training at [Talent Path](https://talentpath.com), we were tasked to create a web solution using the technologies we were learning. We believed that many business finders gave you hard facts about the business, but not how a person felt when they visited that business. Aura attempts to capture the "aura" (vibe) of a business to provide a better search experience.

## Tech/Frameworks used

Special thanks to the wonderful people that have created all the following technologies. If any packages are included but not mentioned, then they will be in the package.json. :heart:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/): A modern build setup with no configuration for react applications.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/): A beautiful, responsive, customizable, accessible replacement for JavaScript's popup boxes.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Vector icons and social logos
- [Jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken): JsonWebToken implementation for Node.js

## Project setup

This project was started with Create React App. Please refer to their [documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) on how to start a react application (if you are interested).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
